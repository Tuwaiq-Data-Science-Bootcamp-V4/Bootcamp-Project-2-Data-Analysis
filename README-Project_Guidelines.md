# Data Preprocessing and Analysis

**Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now, use NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to create a project of your choosing.**

**This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:**

- Choose a public dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- EDA
    - Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, and missing values.
    - Apply the additional EDA steps based on your dataset needs.
- Data Visualization
    - Drive meaningful insights (at least 10 different charts, 5 of them are unique).
    - Draw a subplot using the previous charts.
    - Apply chart format including:
        - Choose a specific style for your charts.
        - Apply one color palette from your choice on all charts.
        - Use title, x and y labels, font size, figure size, and legends.
- Use pandas profiling.
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
    - Team members and their responsibilities.
    - Introduction (problem, objectives).
    - Dataset Overview and Source.
    - Describe the final ten insights.


- **The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).**
- **Due Date: Sat, 12 Aug, 11:00 pm**
## Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
