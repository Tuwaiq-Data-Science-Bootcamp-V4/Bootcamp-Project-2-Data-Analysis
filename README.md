### About EDA steps:
- Handling missing values
  ```python
  df['fast_charging'].fillna('',inplace=True)
  df.fillna({'avg_rating':0},inplace=True)
  df['os'].fillna('NAN',inplace=True)
  df.dropna(subset=['processor_speed','battery_capacity'],inplace=True)
  ```

  
- Combine resolution_height and resolution_width camera_resolution

  ```python
  df['camera_resolution']=df['resolution_height'].astype(str)+" x "+df['resolution_width'].astype(str)
  ```
  
- Dropping column resolution_height and resolution_width after combining them into camera_resolution column
  ```python
  df.drop(['resolution_height', 'resolution_width'], axis=1)
  ```
 - Chainging the price from INR to USD
    ```python
    df['price']=np.round((df['price']*0.012))
    ```
 - Dropping some unneeded columns
    ```python
    df.drop(['processor_brand', 'num_cores','primary_camera_front'], axis=1,inplace=True)
    ```
