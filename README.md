# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis Project ðŸ“Š

## Introduction and Objectives ðŸŽ¯

This project aims to analyze YouTube trending videos data to gain insights into video popularity, viewer engagement, and other key aspects. The project utilizes the dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) containing information about various attributes of YouTube videos.

For this project, we will exclusively focus on the dataset pertaining to YouTube trending videos in the United States.

## Team Members ðŸ‘¥

1. Rayan Aloufi: Choosing the dataset and building the charts and WordCloud.
2. Khalid Alhumaidan: EDA and Data cleaning.
3. Hussam Al-Zhranai: Building the charts and making Pandas Profiling report and README.md file.

## Dataset Overview and Source ðŸ“ˆ

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new). It includes information about video details, such as video ID, trending date, title, channel, category, views, likes, dislikes, comment count, and more.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning ðŸ§¹

The following steps were taken to prepare and clean the dataset for analysis:

- Unnecessary columns were dropped.
- Categories were obtained from the JSON dataset.
- Data was merged with category information.
- Rows with 0 likes and 0 dislikes were removed.
- Dates were formatted and transformed as needed.
- Data was normalized using Min-Max scaling.
- A sample subset of the data was created for further analysis.

## Charts and Insights ðŸ“Š

The analysis includes various charts to visualize trends and relationships within the data:

### 1. Average Views per Category ðŸ“ˆ

- Shows and Nonprofit & Activisim has the lowest.
- Music is not the highest count but it has the highest average views, it is understandable since people listen to music repeatedly.

### Some insights from (Pair plot):
- Views are correlated with likes, dislikes, comment count.
- All of them are left distributed.
- There are huge number of outlires, and non-normal values.
---

### 6. Average Likes for Videos with and without Disabled Comments ðŸ“Š

![Disabled Comments](chart/Bar_DislikesCD.png)

### Some insights from (Average likes and dislikes with comments disabled, 6 and 7):
- When the comments are disabled average percentage of dislikes are usually higher than likes.

### 8. Distribution of Videos by Category (Pie Chart) ðŸ“Š

![Pie](chart/Pie.png)

### Some insights from (disribution of videos per category):
- Entertainment has 24.4% of the total videos in the data set.
- Autos & Vehicles has 0.9%

### Some insights from (Correlation Heatmap):
- Like is highly correlated with views and comment count.
