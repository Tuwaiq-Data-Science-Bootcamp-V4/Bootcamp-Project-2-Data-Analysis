## Dataset Overview:
The dataset is available through the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joyshil0599/data-science-jobs-comprehensive-dataset)

Data on AI, ML, DS & Big Data Jobs is a  dataset containing job opportunities in AI, ML, DS, and Big Data, we used this  dataset to extract meaningful insights we can also have a better understanding of the job market trends and what essential skills that required for the field 


## Dataset Description:
