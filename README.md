# introduction

We Found an interseting to us sense we are in DS bootcamp, it an online survey of 600 Data Engineers or related titles, 100 of which were Manager-Level Employees, so we desided to analyze this survay it might conatain some intersting informaiton.

### **Problems**
- Colums title hard to understand, we had another sheet to discribe the colums.
- Integers values are 5% of all values.
- Values contain a lot of symbols.
- Same Answers for a Question found in different columns, due to multiple choice questions.

### **Objectives**
- Removing all symbols from symbols.
- Using loops for multiple choice questions and turn them to boolean columns.
- Changing question that have a rate to integer so we can find a correlations.
- using the right drawing to visualize the data.


# **Datase Overview**
#### **Data Summary**
Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are <mark>95 in 100</mark> that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than <mark>4.0 percentage</mark> points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.
